### Lessons Learned

Continued to get the order of operations down when navigating from the UI to the controller and so on. Ventured more into the css and styling world and realized the wide range of possibilities there.

Overall it was good to simplify the DB interaction. Assisting others also helped reinforce he order of things and what is all needed to cater to each UI/data need.
